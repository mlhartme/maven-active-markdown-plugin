#### SYNOPSIS

`stool` *global-option*... `import` [`-max`] [`-name` *template*] *directory* ...


#### DESCRIPTION

Scans *directory* for stage candidates and offers to import them. The candidates you
select will be imported, i.e. a backstage directory for the stage directory is created. If the scan only
yields a single candidate, it will be imported and selected without additional interaction.

*template*
is a string defining the stage name. And any occurrence of `%d`
will be replaced by the current directory name. Default template is`%d`.


### stool-select -- Jump between stage directories

#### SYNOPSIS

`stool` *global-option*... `select` *stage*|`none`


#### DESCRIPTION

Prints the selected stage when called without argument.

Otherwise cds to the stage directory of the specified *stage*.

When called with `none`: cds to the parent directory of the current stage.

If the specified stage is not found, the command prints an error message and lists stages that
you could have meant. If you also specified the `-fuzzy` option and there's only a
single candidate, this stage will be selected.
